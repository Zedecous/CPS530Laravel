	<p>The conclusion. Rate your experience with the frameworks that you chose. Did they perform to your expectations? Were they difficult to install or configure? Was it easy to create the page(s) with it? Was the learning curve steep compared with regular HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP? Would you have done things differently in retrospect? Did you regret your choice of frameworks?</p>
