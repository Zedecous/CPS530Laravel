		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		<p>After working with, Semantic UI and Laravel during the course of this project, we have had a chance to be able to experience more on how each of them works. Throughout this section, we will discuss more on our experience with each of the frameworks</p>
		<br>
		<h2>1. Learning experience</h2>
		<p>The learning experience for both of the frameworks were very different. For Semantics UI, due to its similarity with bootstrap, it was pretty easy to learn and use it in our webpage.</p>
		<p>As for Laravel, due to how many different features it has, it had a steeper learning curve compared to Semantic UI. It was much different than just using php to do the backend programming. There were a lot of functionalities which were interesting to learn, but learning how to apply them took much longer to apply in a well fashioned manner.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>2. Installation Experience</h2>
		<p>Installing Semantics was straightforward enough, there were not that many steps that were needed to follow. Laravel on the other hand, was a much tedious process. There were a number of steps that had to be confirmed whether they were working well before proceeding, setting up the right file permissions, and figuring out how to access the server from a remote location due to hosting it on DigitalOcean. Normally every tutorial and documentation that we looked at had the server running as localhost mostly. Once we confirmed that the server was working, it was another tedious process to make sure that the environment was set up correctly.</p>
		<h2>3. Performance Experience</h2>
		<p>Overall performance of the frameworks was good for our project. We found that there was enough documentation to be able to design the webpages in a way we felt fit and that they had enough functionality for the project. For an assignment like this though, I would have only used Semantic UI and not Laravel, due to its simplicity making it be able to just be done through a front end framework. But if I was making the same website but to be on the web for a longer period of time, I would most certainly continue using Laravel as a backend programming language. It's capabilities allow for a website to be managed well, using routes and controllers to go to sites and pages instead of having to do it in html code made it more efficient.</p>
		<h2>4. Final thoughts</h2>
		<p>Looking back on this project, I don't feel that we regretted any of the choices we made, but this could be mostly due to our lack of knowledge to what tools are available to us out there. Semantics UI was enjoyable to use and Laravel did have some nice capabilities. In the future, as we learn more about the frameworks that are available in web design, our opinion on this might change since we will have something to be able to compare against, not including not using the frameworks alltogether.</p>
